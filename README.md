## Decentralized Voting System
This smart contract represents a decentralized voting system written using solidity and test with the *Foundry Framework*.
The contract supports following features:
- Users can register to vote.
- The owner of the contract can add candidate(s).
- Only registered voters can cast their vote for a specific candidate.
- A voter can only vote once.
- The voting process is completely transparent and any user can view the voting results.

**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.**

-   **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
-   **Cast**: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
-   **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.
-   **Chisel**: Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL.
